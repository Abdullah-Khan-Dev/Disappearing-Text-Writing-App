# The Most Dangerous Writing App

The Most Dangerous Writing App is a unique writing tool designed to help you stay focused and keep typing. If you stop typing for more than 5 seconds, all your text will be deleted. This application is built using Python and Tkinter.

## Features

- **Real-Time Typing Monitor**: The app continuously monitors your typing activity.
- **Disappearing Text**: If you stop typing for more than 5 seconds, all text in the text area will be cleared.
- **Visual Timer**: A timer displays the remaining time before text deletion.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python's standard library)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dangerous-writing-app.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd dangerous-writing-app
    ```

3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python dangerous_writing_app.py
    ```

## Usage

- Open the application.
- Start typing in the text area.
- Keep typing continuously to prevent your text from disappearing.
- The timer label at the bottom will show how much time you have left before the text is cleared.

## Code Structure

- `dangerous_writing_app.py`: Main file containing the implementation of the Dangerous Writing App.

## How It Works

- The app uses Tkinter to create a simple GUI with a text area and a timer label.
- A timer is set to 5 seconds. If no key is pressed within this time, the text area is cleared.
- Each key press resets the timer, allowing continuous typing without text deletion.
